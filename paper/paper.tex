\section{Introduction}

1. Overview of problem

2. Traditional approaches for endmember extraction and spectral unmixing

3. Generative topographic mapping

4. Proposed method: generative simplex mapping

5. Summary of paper structure


\section{Generative Simplex Mapping}
\subsection{Method Derivation}

- multiplicative updated to guarantee non-negativity (Generalized EM procedure)
- sum-to-one constraint is guaranteed via representation of latent space with barycentric coordinates.

\subsection{Implementation Details}

- Linear Method

- Nonlinear Method

- Mixed Method


\section{Experiments}
\subsection{Linear Mixing: Comparison to NMF}
- describe USGS data
- describe NMF method (for comparisson)
- describe evaluation criteria

\subsection{Nonlinear Mixing: Water Contaminant Identification}
- describe robot team data collection & processing
- describe 

\section{Results}
\subsection{Linear Mixing}
\subsection{Nonlinear Mixing: Rhodamine Dye Plume}
\subsection{Nonlinear Mixing: Semi-supervised Analysis}


\section{Discussion}

- Comparison to NMF on linear mixing problem
    - note that there are many versions of NMF with different constraints/regularization. The purpose here was to show that GSM is at least \textit{comparable} to NMF for linear unmixing problems
    - Further note that both NMF and GSM do not rely on assumption of pure pixels (unlike VCA and other methods) 
    - GSM also allows estimation of endmember variability via the precision parameter $\beta$ i.e. nodes in data space follow Gaussian distribution with $\sigma = \sqrt{\beta^{-1}}$

- Nonlinear GSM for robot team 
    - discuss identification of rhodamine plume and easy abundance mapping via the embedding coordinate
    - discuss intrinsic dimensionality identification via abundance sparsity and BIC
    - Discuss identification of non-linearity \textit{strenghth} via 

- Discuss  extensions to the GSM
    - batch training as outlined in Bishop paper, extensions to noise model to allow adaptive uncertainty for each wavelength bin

- Discuss other applications of the GSM
    - Optimal route planning for in-situ data collection based on prize-collecting travelling salesman problem, i.e. construct a route which maximizies area traversed in GSM latent space (e.g. the n-simplex). 
    - Applications to source apportionment, e.g. linear GSM can be used for standard source apportionment problems
